- color property lets you specify the color of text inside an element, can specify any color in CSS in 3 ways
    - RGB values, red, green, blue (255,255,255)
    - HEX code, six digit codes, red, green, blue (#ee3e80)
    - Color names, 147 predefined colors in CSS (like DarkCyan)
    - HSLA is another way in CSS3, discussed later

- Hue, natural color
- Saturation, amount of grey in a color
- Brightness, amount of black in a color
- contrast is important, need to actually read the text
    - high contrast means its easy to see, low contrast is harder to see (more blended)
- good contrast tool:

- opacity property lets you set an elements opacity in CSS
    - elements 'clearness'
- when using rgb, you can add a fourth number (aplha number) that determines the colors opacity
- fallbacks are a good idea, some browsesrs dont support rgb and having another set of colors to fall back to can help
- hsla is another way in CSS3 that lets you define a color using a hue, saturation, and lightness values
    - old browsers dont support hsla, need fallbacks
- can set a fallback by giving the colored element two CSS rules in different color schemes and making one have higher precedence in the cascade
