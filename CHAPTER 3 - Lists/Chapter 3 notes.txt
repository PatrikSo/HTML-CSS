Chapter 3 notes:

Summary:
    - Numbered lists
    - Bulleted lists
    - Definition lists

- ordered lists, each item in the list is numbered
- unordered lists, bullet point lists
- definition lists, made up by a set of terms along with the definitions for each
- <ol> element used to make a ordered list
    - <li> element used to add an element to the list
- ol has a type attribute to specify the type of bullet point used but the CSS list-style-type property covered later is better
- <ul> element used to make a unordered list
    - also uses <li> to add elements to the list
- <dl> element used to make a definition list
    - <dt> tag used to contain the term being defined
    - <dd> tag used to contain the definition of the term being defined
- can use nested lists!
