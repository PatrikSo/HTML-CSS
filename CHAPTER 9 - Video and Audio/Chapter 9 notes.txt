Chapter 9 Notes:

Summary:
    - How to add Flash movies to site
    - how to add video and audio to site
    - HTML5 <video> and <audio> elements

- FLASH IS NO LONGER SUPPORTED 
- (skipped Flash portions of this chapter)

- Javascript used to add Flash movies
- SWFObject Javascript used in examples here

- adding audio/video to sites requires two things
    - file formats
    - video players/plugins
- encoding a video is changing it to another format
- might have to change video formats 
- websites made before 2010 will generally require a plugin/player
    - websites originally only made for images and text
- <video> tag in HTML5 lets you put vids in your site (makes players/plugins useless)
- not every user may be using HTML5 and still may need a plugin/player
- Using HTML5, you need to upload in WebM and MP4 formats for videos on your site
- can use hosted video sites (like YouTube)
- preparing flash video for site:
    - convert video into flv
    - find flv player and play video
    - include player & video in web page
- HTML5 <video> element things to be aware of:
    - Support (tag only supported on recent browsers)
    - Digital Rights (doesnt support DRM, Digital Rights Management)
    - Formats (not all browsers support same video formats)
        - useful formats:
            - H264 (for InternetExplorer and Safari)
            - WebM (for Android, Chrome, Firefox, Opera)
    - Controls (browsers supply their own player controls_
    - The Browser (how the browser handles elements can make things look bad)
- <video> tag used to display video using HTML5
    - video attributes
        - preload, tells browser what to do when page loads
            - none, doesnt load when page does 
            - auto, video loads when page does
            - metadata, browser just collects the data (information)
        - src, path to video
        - poster, lets you specify an image to show while the video is downloading or when video starts playing
        - width, height, sizes for video
        - controls, allows the browser to use its video playback controls
        - autoplay, makes the video file play automatically
        - loop, video starts over when finished
- <source> element can be used inside the <video> element (instead of attribute src), useful for playing several videos
    - source attributes
        - src, specifies path to video
        - type, the format of the video
        - codecs, the codec used to encode the video
- can combine Flash and HTML5 video plays
- <audio> element used to add audio to your page using HTML5
    - audio attributes
        - src, filepath to audio file
        - controls, can let browser use its default playback
        - autoplay, if audio should play automatically
        - preload, tells browser what to do as audio loads (same as <video>)
        - loop, can loop audio
- <source> also works for audio (for multiple audio sources)

Summary:
    - Flash allows you to add animations, video and audio to web
    - Flash is no supported on iPhone or iPad (or anymore for a fact)
    - HTML5 has <video> for adding vids and <audio> for adding audio (only supported on latest browsers)
    - Browsers that support HTML5 elements do not all support same video and audio formats/elements, need to supply different formats so everyone can see/hear
