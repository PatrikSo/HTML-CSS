Chapter 5 notes:

Summary:
    - How to add images to pages
    - Choosing correct format
    - Optimizing images for the web

- can use CSS to add images using the backgroun-image property 
- good practice to save all website used images in one folder
- <img> element is used to put images into your page
- <img> has no closing tag, needs a source, an alt and a title
- attribute src is where you find the image
- attribute alt is a text description of the image (if the image cant be seen)
- attribute title is used for additional information on the image
- img attributes width and height used for image size
- CSS can be used for specifying image height and width (recommended)
- Block elements always appear on a new line ( <h1> or <p> )
- Inline elements sit within a block level element and dont start new lines (like <b>, <em>, <img>)
- align attribute used to determine placement of image,  (removed in HTML 5, use CSS to do this)
    - can be set to top, middle, bottom, right, left
- 3 rules for creating images:
    - Save images in the right format
    - Save images at the right size
    - Use the correct resolution 
- images for the web should have a resolution of 72 ppi
- JPGs, GIFs, and PNGs belong to a format called bitmap
- images with anything larger than 72 ppi only slow down the website
- <figure> element used to contain images and their caption (so the two are associated)
- <figcapion> element has been added, allows web page authors to adda  caption to an image

Summary:
    - <img> used to add images on the web
    - must specify the src attribute for <img> to locate the actual image, alt attribute used to describe the content of the image
    - save images in their appropriate format
    - photo's are best saved as JPEGs, images using flat colors are better saved as GIFs
