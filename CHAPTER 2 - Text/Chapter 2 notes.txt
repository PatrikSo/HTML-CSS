Chapter 2 notes:

Summary:
    - Headings and paragraphs
    - Bold, Italics, Emphasis
    - Structural and Semantic markup

- Structural markup, elements used to describe headings and parapgraphs 
- Semantic markup, provides extra information (like emphasis in sentences, quotations, so on)
- HTML has 6 levels of headings (h1 to h6)
- <p></p> is for paragraphs
- <b></b> bolds text
- <i></i> italics for text
- <sup></sup> makes the text a superscript
- <sub></sub> makes the text a subscript
- white space collapsing, when a page noticed more than one white space next to one another or a line break they are treated as a single space.
- <br /> adds a line break anywhere you add this tag
- <hr /> adds a horizontal rule (line)
- empty elements, elements that dont have any words inbetween an opening and closing tag (usually has only one tag)
- visual editors, resemble word processors
- code views, views that show you the code created by the visual editor for manual editing
- semantic markup, markup only meant to be read (not part of code)
- <em> allows you to indicate where emphasis should be placed
- <blockquote> indicates that a block of text is a quotation, longer quotes that take a whole paragraph
    - <em> and <blockquote> are helpful for search engines, shows them what possible content your web has
- <strong> indicates the content has strong importance
- <q> is used for shorter quotes than <blockquote> (doesnt work with explorer)
- quotes come with a cite attribute for a URL leading to the quotes location
- <abbr> is for abbreviations or an acronym 
    - title attribute used to specify the whole term
- HTML 4 has a seperate tag for acronym's but HTML 5 combined them
- <cite> is used for referencing a piece of work such as a book
- <dfn> element is used to indicate the defining instance of a new term (research paper fun)
- <address> used to contain the contact information of the author of the page
- hCard microformat for adding physical address information to markup 
- <ins> element used to show something that was added to a document
- <del> element used to show text that was deleted from the document
- <s> element indicates something that is no longer accurate or relevant (should be deleted)

Summary:
    - HTML elements used to describe the structure of a page (headings, subheadings, paragraphs)
    - HTML elements used for semantic information (emphasis in text, definitions of acronyms, quotations)
