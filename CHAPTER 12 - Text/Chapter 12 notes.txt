    - Stretch, refers to the space between letters in words in a font
- a browser will only display the font that the user has installed
- browsers typically support one type of font
- techniques for text:
    - Font-Family, fonts that are installed on the users computer
    - Font-Face, font to be downloaded by CSS if user doesnt have it installed
    - Service-Based-Font-Face, commercial products you can buy for cool fonts
