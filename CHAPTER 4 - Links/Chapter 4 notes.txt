Summary:
    - creating links between pages
    - linking to other sites

- links are the main idea behind websites, they allow you to surf the web
- types of links:
    - links between two sites
    - links between pages in a site
    - links between parts of a page
    - links that open new windows
    - links that start your email 

- <a> element used to create a linke
- can click anywhere between the <a> and </a> tag
- href attribute for a links specifies where you go
- clear link text is always good, helps visitors and people using screen reader software
- linking to a different website require the href attribute value to be that sites URL
- absolute URL, a websites full web address
- URL, stands for Uniform Resource Locator, every web page has one
- absolute URL starts with the domain name, followed by the path to the page
- relative URL, URL without the domain name
- realtive URLs are used in the href attribute when linking two pages on the same website
- realtive URLs are helpful for setting up websites when you arent hosting it yet
- folders on a website are referred to as directories
- root folder, folder that contains all other website folders and pages
- placing sections of the website into different folders helps organize the website
- relationships are described as a family tree (parent directory, child directory, so on)
- relative URLs are used for pages in the same directory
- to use emails, the href attributes value will have a mailto: in it
- mailto: is followed by the email address you want the email to be sent to
- to open a new window with a link you can use the target attribute in a link
- you set the target="_blank" opens the href address in a new window
- you use the id attribute thats part of any tag to identify the specific tag
- you then use the id attribute for a specific tag to link to that part of the page 
- id is used for linking parts of a page to that same page (just a different part of it)

Summary:
    - Links are created using the <a> element
    - <a> element uses the href attribute to indicate the page you are linking to
    - if linking a page within your own site, best to use relative URLs than absolute ones
    - if linking a email, you use the mailto: text in the href attribute then place the email
    - if linking to another part of the same page, you use the id attribute in every tag to refrence that specific tag in the href of the link
