Chapter 10 notes:

Summary:
    - What is CSS
    - How it works
    - Rules, properties and values

- CSS lets you specify rules on how elements can appear
- CSS rules are the main part of the language, most of the work is remembering the properties
- Block level elements are all surrounded by a invisible block, can change its appearance using CSS
- In-line elements can also be targeted by specific CSS rules
- CSS rules come in two parts, a selector and a declaration
    - selectors choose what gets applied to the rule
    - declaration chooses what that rule does
- CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and also have two parts 
    - property, indicating what you want to change from the element
    - value, value for that given property
- can put CSS rules into a seperate file (can keep HTML and CSS code somewhat seperate)
- <link> element is used to tell the page where to find the CSS file
    - lives inside the head element
    - link attributes:
        - href, specifies path
        - type, specifies type of document (should be text/css, for CSS)
        - rel, specifies relationship between HTML page and file its linking (should be stylesheet, for CSS)
- link element per CSS file used!
- <style> element is used to put CSS code directly into the HTML code
    - use the type attribute with value "text/css" inside <style>
    - CSS code goes between the <style> and </style>
- Multi-page sites should use CSS externally (seperate file)
    - all pages follow same rules
    - keeps content seperate/organized
    - can change full site style by altering one page
- can use a style attribute for most elements in HTML4 and XHTML (but avoid this)
- selectors let you target specific elements in your page
- types of selectors:
    - Universal selector
        - applies rule to all elements in document
    - Type selector
        - matches element names for rules
    - Class selector
        - matches elements whose class attribute matches
    - ID selector
        - matches elements whose id matches
    - Child selector
        - matches element that is a direct child of another
    - Descendant selector
        - matches element that is a descendent to specified element
    - Adjacent Sibling selector  (only common in IE 7)
        - matches the element that is the next sibling to another
    - General Sibling selector   (only common in IE 7)
        - matches element that is a sibling to another (not only direct siblings)
- CSS rules cascade
    - the last CSS rule applied to the element is used (if more than one rule is targeting element)
    - more specific rules take precedence over general ones (so h1 rules always take over ones that target the whole page)
- can use !important after any property value to make it a higher precedence in a cascade
- elements inherit rules/properties, elements inside a body will have the same text affects, so on
- can make any child inherit from its parent using inherit inside the properties
- having external CSS code for your site has advantages:
    - site runs faster
    - easier to manage the site style
- CSS history
    - CSS1 was made in 1996
    - CSS2 was made in 1998
    - CSS3 is ongoing, is now being implemented
- Just like HTML, older browsers may not support all new features, need to keep an eye out!
- Sites to test your site on several browsers:
    - http://browsercam.com/
    - http://browserlab.adobe.com/
    - http://browsershots.org/
    - http://crossbrowsertesting.com/
- also check site on different operating systems and in older versions of browsers
- browser quirk/CSS bug, when CSS properties may look different between browsers 
- sites to fix browser bugs:

    - http://quirksmode.org/

Summary:
    - CSS treats HTML elements as if they are in their own boxes, use rules to change how they look
    - Rules are made by using selectors and declarations
        - selectors indicate which elements are to be targeted 
        - declarations indicate what value they should take
    - many types of selectors to target specific groups
    - declarations have two parts
        - properties of elements you want to change
        - value for the properties to be changed
    - CSS rules can appear in doc or seperate of the HTML page
