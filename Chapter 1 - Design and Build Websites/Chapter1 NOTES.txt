Summary:
   - see how HTML describes the structure of a web page
   - learn how tags or elements are added to a doc
   - writting your first web-page

- hierarchy of information
- there is a structure in  web pages
- structure begins with <html>, then <body>, then anything inbetween (like <h#> for headers where # is a number or <p> for paragraph)
- HTML code in blue is made up of characters that live in brackets (angled) [known as HTML elements]
- elements are made up of two tags, opening and closing tags
- tags tell you about the information inbetween
- tag and element are interchangeable
- attributes give more information on whats inside an element, appearing in the opening tag, they are made up of two parts (name and value)
- name idicates what kind of extra info. is being given
- value indicates the setting of the extra info. being given

- <body> everything in the body is shown inside the main browser window
- <head> information about the page, usually there is a <title> element inside the <head> element
- <title> content here is shown either in the top of the browser (in URL area) or on the tab for that page (if browser supports tabs)

- HTML stands for HyperText Markup language
- using Notepad++ for examples from textbook

- Content Management System, areas such as a administrator section of a blog website
- parts of the content management system only let you edit pieces of the page, so you wont see <html> or <body>

- looking at source code of any website can help you learn the HTML
- click "View Source" on any page (or find the setting) and it's HTML will display

SUMMARY:
   - HTML pages are text documents
   - HTML uses tags to give info special meaning
   - tags are often called elements too (interchangable)
   - Tags normally come in pairs (opening tagm closing tag, opening tag as the attributes)
   - Opening tags carry attributes (optional), tell us more on the content of the elements
   - to learn HTML you need to know what tags are available to use, what they do, and where they can go!
